# React Hooks & CRUD Demo Application

This project is a simple React application created to demonstrate fundamental React concepts, including state management, props, and essential hooks.

## Features

This application is divided into three main parts:

1.  **üìù React CRUD Application**

      * Demonstrates basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
      * Add new users with a name and email.
      * View the list of added users.
      * (Future Implementation: Edit and Delete functionality).

2.  **üîÑ `useCallback` Hook Demo**

      * An interactive example illustrating the use of the `useCallback` hook.
      * Helps in understanding how to memoize functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders of child components.

3.  **‚öôÔ∏è `useMemo` Hook Demo**

      * An interactive example showing how the `useMemo` hook works.
      * Demonstrates how to memoize expensive calculations so that they are not re-executed on every render.
